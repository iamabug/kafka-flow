# sunny
An experimental project that mimics [Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/) to provide a web-based, interactive data analysis/operational  tool.

## Motivation

As a programmer/IT engineer/big data developer, I am eager to learn something in my spare time. I have tried a lot of methods which do not work for me. Methods include:

* Read documentation & books - no feedback, I cannot see my own progress in it.
* Read source code - just too boring and exhausting and I have given up dozens of times already. 
* Do a good project from work - Something you cannot ask for, doesn't happen very often.
* Contribute to community - another method I am trying and comments will be added later (today is 2019-11-27)

Hence, this project is an exploration for a good learning method. I use it to force myself to learn something proactively.

## Method

* Build everything from scratch - I expect it to be both challenging and interesting.
* Code & think & write at the same time - I believe summary and communication is extremely important.
* Do things as stupid as possible - K.I.S.S
* Increase complexity and adjust design only when is absolutely necessary - so that I can learn why and how every framework is built as they are.
* Enough is good when learning new knowledge - because I do not have enough time to learn even more.

In my experience, I am not very good at doing a long-term project. So there is a good chance that this project is created in private and deleted in private. In that case, "nice try" to myself.

## About project name

The project is named after a boat called "thousand sunny" from my favorite animation [One Piece](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONE_PIECE).
